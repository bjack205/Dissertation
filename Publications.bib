  abstract = {In this work, the relative capabilities and limitations of electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) and cross-correlation electron backscattered diffraction (CC-EBSD) have been assessed by studying the dislocation distributions resulting from nanoindentation in body centered cubic Ta. Qualitative comparison reveals very similar dislocation distributions between the CC-EBSD mapped GNDs and the ECC imaged dislocations. Approximate dislocation densities determined from ECC images compare well to those determined by CC-EBSD. Nevertheless, close examination reveals subtle differences in the details of the distributions mapped by these two approaches. The details of the dislocation Burgers vectors and line directions determined by ECCI have been compared to those determined using CC-EBSD and reveal good agreement.},

  abstract = {Studies of dislocation density evolution are fundamental to improved understanding in various areas of deformation mechanics. Recent advances in cross-correlation techniques, applied to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data have particularly shed light on geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) behavior. However, the framework is relatively computationally expensive—patterns are typically saved from the EBSD scan and analyzed offline. A better understanding of the impact of EBSD pattern degradation, such as binning, compression, and various forms of noise, is vital to enable optimization of rapid and low-cost GND analysis. This paper tackles the problem by setting up a set of simulated patterns that mimic real patterns corresponding to a known GND field. The patterns are subsequently degraded in terms of resolution and noise, and the GND densities calculated from the degraded patterns using cross-correlation ESBD are compared with the known values. Some confirmation of validity of the computational degradation of patterns by considering real pattern degradation is also undertaken. The results demonstrate that the EBSD technique is not particularly sensitive to lower levels of binning and image compression, but the precision is sensitive to Poisson-type noise. Some insight is also gained concerning effects of mixed patterns at a grain boundary on measured GND content.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool with many important applications in robotic motion planning and control. However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints. We demonstrate ALTRO’s capabilities on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation (DIRCOL) method.},

  abstract = {Model-predictive control (MPC) is an increasingly popular method for controlling complex robotic systems in which optimal control problems are solved on board the robot at realtime rates. However, successful application of MPC depends critically on the performance of the algorithms used to solve the underlying optimization problems. An ideal solver should both leverage the structure of the MPC problem and support efficient “warm starting” so that information from previous solutions can be recycled to speed convergence. We present ALTRO-C, a highperformance solver with both of these properties that utilizes an augmented Lagrangian method to handle general convex conic constraints. We demonstrate the new solver’s superior performance against several existing state-of-the-art solvers on a variety of benchmark control problems formulated as both quadratic and second-order cone programs.},

  abstract = {High-resolution (or “cross-correlation”) electron backscatter diffraction analysis (HR-EBSD) utilizes cross-correlation techniques to determine relative orientation and distortion of an experimental electron backscatter diffraction pattern with respect to a reference pattern. The integrity of absolute strain and tetragonality measurements of a standard Si/SiGe material have previously been analyzed using reference patterns produced by kinematical simulation. Although the results were promising, the noise levels were significantly higher for kinematically produced patterns, compared with real patterns taken from the Si region of the sample. This paper applies HR-EBSD techniques to analyze lattice distortion in an Si/SiGe sample, using recently developed dynamically simulated patterns. The results are compared with those from experimental and kinematically simulated patterns. Dynamical patterns provide significantly more precision than kinematical patterns. Dynamical patterns also provide better estimates of tetragonality at low levels of distortion relative to the reference pattern; kinematical patterns can perform better at large values of relative tetragonality due to the ability to rapidly generate patterns relating to a distorted lattice. A library of dynamically generated patterns with different lattice parameters might be used to achieve a similar advantage. The convergence of the cross-correlation approach is also assessed for the different reference pattern types.},

  abstract = {Pseudosymmetry is a phenomenon that occurs when grains with different lattice parameters produce nearly identical diffraction patterns such that conventional electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques are unable to unambiguously differentiate the lattice orientations. This commonly occurs in materials with near-unity tetragonality, such as γ-TiAl. The current study uses cross-correlation EBSD to resolve pseudosymmetry in γ-TiAl. Three dynamically simulated reference patterns are generated for each point in the scan, one for each of the three potential pseudosymmetric orientations, which are subsequently correlated with the original pattern using six different methods in order to identify the correct orientation. The methods are first applied to a scan of dynamically simulated patterns, which is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the method to pattern resolution, pattern noise and pattern center error. It was determined that all six methods were 100\% successful up to about 13\hspace{0.25em}µm of pattern center error and pattern resolutions of about 80 × 80 pixels, and hence the methods were applied to an experimental sample of lamellar γ-TiAl. A hybrid combination of two of the methods was shown to successfully select the correct pseudosymmetry for about 96\% of the points in the scan, improving upon the 70\% accuracy of the Hough-based methods for the current study and 90\% accuracy for previous studies resolving pseudosymmetry in lamellar γ-TiAl.},

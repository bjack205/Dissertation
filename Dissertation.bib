  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) has its reputation since it can handle multiple inputs and outputs with consideration to constraints. However, this comes at the cost of high computational complexity, which limits MPC to slow dynamic systems. This paper provides an overview of the available methods to accelerate the MPC process. Various parallel computing approaches using different technologies were proposed to speed up the execution of MPC, some of these approaches are focused on building dedicated hardware for MPC using field programmable arrays (FPGA), and others are focused on parallelizing MPC computation using multi-core processors (CPUs) and many-core processors (GPUs). The focus of this survey is to review the available methods for accelerating MPC process. A brief introduction to the theory of MPC is provided first followed by a description of each approach. A comparison between the different methods is presented in terms of complexity and performance followed by a valid application for each approach. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges and requirements of MPC for future applications.},

  abstract = {Planetary soft landing is one of the benchmark problems of optimal control theory and is gaining renewed interest due to the increased focus on the exploration of planets in the solar system, such as Mars. The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states. The main difficulty in solving this constrained problem is the existence of nonconvex constraints on the control input, which are due to a nonzero lower bound on the control input magnitude and a nonconvex constraint on its direction. This paper introduces a convexification of the control constraints that is proven to be lossless; i.e., an optimal solution of the soft landing problem can be obtained via solution of the proposed convex relaxation of the problem. The lossless convexification enables the use of interior point methods of convex optimization to obtain optimal solutions of the original nonconvex optimal control problem.},

In this work we develop an hardware-in-loop simulation technique, where a simulation of the space robot dynamics is combined with emulation of the contact dynamics by using a rigid robot prototype performing the contact task. The rigid robot is not dynamically or kinematically equivalent to the space robot, but it is controlled so that its endpoint dynamics replicates that of the space robot.

The actual emulating robot is structurally rigid, while the target robot can represent any class of robots, e.g., flexible, redundant, or space robots.

  abstract = {To effectively control large-scale distributed systems online, model predictive control (MPC) has to swiftly solve the underlying high-dimensional optimization. There are multiple techniques applied to accelerate the solving process in the literature, mainly attributed to software-based algorithmic advancements and hardware-assisted computation enhancements. However, those methods focus on arithmetic accelerations and overlook the benefits of the underlying system's structure. In particular, the existing decoupled software-hardware algorithm design that naively parallelizes the arithmetic operations by the hardware does not tackle the hardware overheads such as CPU-GPU and thread-to-thread communications in a principled manner. Also, the advantages of parallelizable subproblem decomposition in distributed MPC are not well recognized and exploited. As a result, we have not reached the full potential of hardware acceleration for MPC. In this paper, we explore those opportunities by leveraging GPU to parallelize the distributed and localized MPC (DLMPC) algorithm. We exploit the locality constraints embedded in the DLMPC formulation to reduce the hardware-intrinsic communication overheads. Our parallel implementation achieves up to 50x faster runtime than its CPU counterparts under various parameters. Furthermore, we find that the locality-aware GPU parallelization could halve the optimization runtime comparing to the naive acceleration. Overall, our results demonstrate the performance gains brought by software-hardware co-design with the information exchange structure in mind.},

We base our results on Distributed and Localized Model Predictive Control (DLMPC), a closed-loop model predictive control scheme based on the System Level Synthesis (SLS) framework wherein only local state and model information needs to be exchanged between subsystems for the computation and implementation of control actions. We provide an explicit solution for each of the subproblems resulting from the distributed MPC scheme. We show that given the separability of the problem, the explicit solution is only divided into three regions per state and input instantiation, making the point location problem very efficient. Moreover, given the locality constraints, the subproblems are of much smaller dimension than the full problem, which significantly reduces the computational overhead of explicit solutions. We conclude with numerical simulations to demonstrate the computational advantages of our method, in which we show a large improvement in runtime per MPC iteration as compared with the results of computing the optimization with a solver online.},

The control algorithm is constructed in order to improve two possible outputs: firstly, precisely tracking a given desired trajectory for a quadrotor with load, and, secondly, considering an anti-swing load through a transporting task. Two challenges have been taken into account: aggressive trajectory tracking and stability in behaviour; these must be guaranteed for the full UAV carrying the payload. The high nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor with a consiseration of the cable suspended payload is represented in eleven degrees of freedom. Subsequently, the nonlinear dynamic model is linearised in two modes, a vehicle mode without a load effect during a taking-off task and a switching-to-quad-load system mode considering the load effect used in a simulation. The simulation results are presented to illustrate the system stability improvement and precise implementation through verifying the ILQR parameters in comparison with the LQR controller.},

The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

The algorithm is designed to exploit the parallelism inherent in the indirect shooting method while maximizing computational efficiency. The resulting rapid optimal control framework enables the construction of high quality optimal trajectories that satisfy constraints and the necessary conditions of optimality. The performance of the framework is highlighted by construction of maximum terminal velocity trajectories for a hypothetical long-range weapon system. Various hypothetical mission scenarios that enforce different combinations of initial, terminal, interior point, and path constraints that demonstrate the rapid construction of complex trajectories are used to compare performance of the graphics-processing-units-accelerated solver to MATLAB®’s bvp4c. Trajectory problems of this kind were previously considered impractical to solve using indirect methods. The graphics-processing-units-accelerated solver is found to be two to four times faster than MATLAB®’s bvp4c for a small-dimensional system, even while running on graphics processing units hardware that is five years behind the state of the art.},

  abstract = {The thesis presents a two-stage approach for designing optimal reconfiguration maneuvers for multiple spacecraft. These maneuvers involve well-coordinated and highly-coupled motions of the entire fleet of spacecraft while satisfying an arbitrary number of constraints. This problem is particularly difficult because of the nonlinearity of the attitude dynamics, the non-convexity of some of the constraints, and the coupling between the positions and attitudes of all spacecraft. As a result, the trajectory design must be solved as a single 6N DOF problem instead of N separate 6 DOF problems. The first stage of the solution approach quickly provides a feasible initial solution by solving a simplified version without differential constraints using a bi-directional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner. A transition algorithm then augments this guess with feasible dynamics that are propagated from the beginning to the end of the trajectory. The resulting output is a feasible initial guess to the complete optimal control problem that is discretized in the second stage using a Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) and solved using an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. This thesis also places emphasis on the importance of the initialization step in pseudospectral methods in order to decrease their computation times. It demonstrates the improvement that an initial guess based on an RRT planner brings to an optimal control problem solved using pseudospectral methods. Finally, this thesis presents the successful results of several reconfiguration maneuver experiments performed using the Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) hardware testbed onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The maneuvers were designed using two different two-stage algorithms presented in this work. It also discusses the lessons learned from these tests, and the recommendations to improve future ISS reconfiguration experiments.},

The first stage is solved using a bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner.

  abstract = {Our paper proposes a model predictive controller as a single-task formulation that simultaneously optimizes wheel and torso motions. This online joint velocity and ground reaction force optimization integrates a kinodynamic model of a wheeled quadrupedal robot. It defines the single rigid body dynamics along with the robot's kinematics while treating the wheels as moving ground contacts. With this approach, we can accurately capture the robot's rolling constraint and dynamics, enabling automatic discovery of hybrid maneuvers without needless motion heuristics. The formulation's generality through the simultaneous optimization over the robot's whole-body variables allows for a single set of parameters and makes online gait sequence adaptation possible. Aperiodic gait sequences are automatically found through kinematic leg utilities without the need for predefined contact and lift-off timings, reducing the cost of transport by up to 85 \%. Our experiments demonstrate dynamic motions on a quadrupedal robot with non-steerable wheels in challenging indoor and outdoor environments. The paper's findings contribute to evaluating a decomposed, i.e., sequential optimization of wheel and torso motion, and single-task motion planner with a novel quantity, the prediction error, which describes how well a receding horizon planner can predict the robot's future state. To this end, we report an improvement of up to 71 \% using our proposed single-task approach, making fast locomotion feasible and revealing wheeled-legged robots' full potential.}

  abstract = {To increase the science return of future missions to Mars and to enable sample return missions, the accuracy with which a lander can be delivered to the Martian surface must be improved by orders of magnitude. The prior work developed a convex-optimization-based minimum-fuel powered-descent guidance algorithm. In this paper, this convex-optimization-based approach is extended to handle the case when no feasible trajectory to the target exists. In this case, the objective is to generate the minimum-landing-error trajectory, which is the trajectory that minimizes the distance to the prescribed target while using the available fuel optimally. This problem is inherently a nonconvex optimal control problem due to a nonzero lower bound on the magnitude of the feasible thrust vector. It is first proven that an optimal solution of a convex relaxation of the problem is also optimal for the original nonconvex problem, which is referred to as a lossless convexification of the original nonconvex problem. Then it is shown that the minimum-landing-error trajectory generation problem can be posed as a convex optimization problem and solved to global optimality with known bounds on convergence time. This makes the approach amenable to onboard implementation for real-time applications. Nomenclature c = vector component of cone constraint D = constraint on distance-to-target in horizontal plane},

Often in academic literature not enough attention is given to the implementation details that make the theory work in practice and many times it is precisely these details that end up being critical to the success or failure of the theory in real world applications. Nonlinear optimization for real-time legged locomotion control in particular is one of the techniques that has shown promise, but falls short when implemented on hardware systems subjected to computation limits and undesirable local minima.

Yet, most available methods lack rigorous performance guarantees and are often tailored to specific optimal control setups. In this paper, we present GuSTO (Guaranteed Sequential Trajectory Optimization), an algorithmic framework to solve trajectory optimization problems for control-affine systems with drift. GuSTO generalizes earlier SCP-based methods for trajectory optimization (by addressing, for example, goal region constraints and problems with either fixed or free final time), and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees in terms of convergence to, at least, a stationary point. The theoretical analysis is further leveraged to devise an accelerated implementation of GuSTO, which originally infuses ideas from indirect optimal control into an SCP context. Numerical experiments on a variety of trajectory optimization setups show that GuSTO generally outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of success rates, solution quality, and computation times.},

  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for ℓ1 problems, proximal methods, and thers. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations. © 2011 S.

This letter describes how the Koopman operator can be used to generate approximate linear, bilinear, and nonlinear model realizations from data, and argues in favor of bilinear realizations for characterizing systems with unknown dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a dynamical system to have a valid linear or bilinear realization over a given set of observable functions are presented and used to show that every control-affine system admits an infinite-dimensional bilinear realization, but does not necessarily admit a linear one. Therefore, approximate bilinear realizations constructed from generic sets of basis functions tend to improve as the number of basis functions increases, whereas approximate linear realizations may not. To demonstrate the advantages of bilinear Koopman realizations for control, a linear, bilinear, and nonlinear Koopman model realization of a simulated robot arm is constructed from data. In a trajectory following task, the bilinear realization exceeds the prediction accuracy of the linear realization and the computational efficiency of the nonlinear realization when incorporated into a model predictive control framework.},

  abstract = {The linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) is an efficient control method for linear and linearized systems. Typically, LQR is implemented in minimal coordinates (also called generalized or “joint” coordinates). However, other coordinates are possible and recent research suggests that there may be numerical and control-theoretic advantages when using higher-dimensional non-minimal state parameterizations for dynamical systems. One such parameterization is maximal coordinates, in which each link in a multi-body system is parameterized by its full six degrees of freedom and joints between links are modeled with algebraic constraints. Such constraints can also represent closed kinematic loops or contact with the environment. This paper investigates the difference between minimal- and maximal-coordinate LQR control laws. A case study of applying LQR to a simple pendulum and simulations comparing the basins of attraction of minimal- and maximal-coordinate LQR controllers suggest that maximal-coordinate LQR achieves greater robustness and improved performance compared to minimal-coordinate LQR when applied to nonlinear systems.},

However, maximal-coordinate approaches have several advantages over minimal-coordinate parameterizations, including native handling of closed kinematic loops and nonholonomic constraints. This paper describes a linear-time variational integrator that is formulated in maximal coordinates. Due to its variational formulation, the algorithm does not suffer from constraint drift and has favorable energy and momentum conservation properties. A sparse matrix factorization technique allows the dynamics of a loop-free articulated mechanism with n links to be computed in O(n) (linear) time. Additional constraints that introduce loops can also be handled by the algorithm without incurring much computational overhead. Experimental results show that our approach offers speed competitive with existing minimalcoordinate algorithms while outperforming them in several scenarios, especially when dealing with closed loops and configuration singularities.},

The calculus of variations was developed further in the 18th century by Euler and Lagrange and in the 19th century by Legendre, Jacobi, Hamilton, and Weierstrass. In the early 20th century, Bolza and Bliss put the final touches of rigor on the subject. In 1957, Bellman gave a new view of Hamilton-Jacobi theory which he called dynamic programming, essentially a nonlinear feedback control scheme. McShane (1939) and Pontryagin (1962) extended the calculus of variations to handle control variable inequality constraints, the latter enunciating his elegant maximum principle. The truly enabling element for use of optimal control theory was the digital computer, which became available commercially in the 1950s. In the 1980s research began, and continues today, on making optimal feedback logic more robust to variations in the plant and disturbance models; one element of this research is worst-case and H-infinity control, which developed out of differential game theory.},

This work is motivated by a novel method for computing geodesics over Riemannian man-ifolds. If blocks are reduced sequentially along the diagonal, only limited parallelism is available. We propose a matrix permutation approach based on the Nested Dissection method which improves parallelism at the cost of additional computations and storage. We provide a detailed analysis of the approach showing that this extra cost is bounded. Finally, we present an implementation for shared memory systems relying on task parallelism and the use of a runtime system. Experimental results support the conclusions of our analysis and show that the proposed approach leads to good performance and scalability.},

The motivation for this work stems from supervised machine learning applications involving a very large number of training points. We follow a batch approach, also known in the stochastic optimization literature as a sample average approximation (SAA) approach. Curvature information is incorporated in two sub-sampled Hessian algorithms, one based on a matrix-free inexact Newton iteration and one on a preconditioned limited memory BFGS iteration. A crucial feature of our technique is that Hessian-vector multiplications are carried out with a significantly smaller sample size than is used for the function and gradient. The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated using a machine learning application involving speech recognition.},

With the simplified model, ground reaction force planning problems are formulated for prediction horizons of up to 0.5 seconds, and are solved to optimality in under 1 ms at a rate of 20-30 Hz. Despite using a simplified model, the robot is capable of robust locomotion at a variety of speeds. Experimental results demonstrate control of gaits including stand, trot, flying-trot, pronk, bound, pace, a 3-legged gait, and a full 3D gallop. The robot achieved forward speeds of up to 3 m/s, lateral speeds up to 1 m/s, and angular speeds up to 180 deg/sec.

The 3-D pendulum has two disjoint equilibrium manifolds, namely a hanging equilibrium manifold and an inverted equilibrium manifold. The contribution of this paper is that two fundamental stabilization problems for the inverted 3-D pendulum are posed and solved. The first problem, asymptotic stabilization of a specified equilibrium in the inverted equilibrium manifold, is solved using smooth and globally defined feedback of angular velocity and attitude of the 3-D pendulum. The second problem, asymptotic stabilization of the inverted equilibrium manifold, is solved using smooth and globally defined feedback of angular velocity and a reduced attitude vector of the 3-D pendulum. These control problems for the 3-D pendulum exemplify attitude stabilization problems on the configuration manifold SO(3) in the presence of potential forces. Lyapunov analysis and nonlinear geometric methods are used to assess global closed-loop properties, yielding a characterization of the almost global domain of attraction for each case.},

This discovery may help to explain the good numerical performance of several recently developed semismooth Newton-CG based ALM solvers for linear and convex quadratic semidefinite programming.},

One of the main features of invariant observers for invariant systems on Lie groups is that the estimation error is autonomous, hence the observable state variables can be rendered convergent within a domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (In-EKF) which is an extension of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is supposed to be more efficient given that the system converges to constant values on a larger set of trajectories as opposed to the equilibrium points that an EKF is based on. This paper explores the implementation of the In-EKF for robot localization and is compared against an implementation of the EKF. The localization is performed on the University of Michigan north campus long-term vision and LIDAR dataset.}

The hybrid model of the quadrotor with the load is introduced, and four sample tasks are presented. These tasks consist of a simple waypoint task as well as a task where the quadrotor and the load have to pass through a small window. The window task requires more aggressive control, exploiting the underactuated system dynamics including system mode switches, where the load is in free fall for some period of time.},

  abstract = {In recent years impressive results have been presented illustrating the potential of quadrotors to solve challenging tasks. Generally, the derivation of the controllers involve complex analytical manipulation of the dynamics and are very specific to the task at hand. In addition, most approaches construct a trajectory and then design a stabilizing controller in a separate step, whereas a fully optimal solution requires finding both simultaneously. In this paper, a generalized approach is presented using an iterative optimal control algorithm. A series of complex tasks are thus solved using the same algorithm without the need for manual manipulation of the system dynamics, heuristic simplifications, or manual trajectory generation. First, aggressive maneuvers are performed by requiring the quadrotor to pass with a slung load through a window not high enough for the load to pass while hanging straight down. Second, go-to-goal tasks with single and double rotor failure are demonstrated. The adaptability and applicability of this unified approach to such diverse tasks with a nonlinear, underactuated, constrained, and in the case of the slung load, hybrid quadrotor systems is thus shown.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the embedded conic solver (ECOS), an interior-point solver for second-order cone programming (SOCP) designed specifically for embedded applications. ECOS is written in low footprint, single-threaded, library-free ANSI-C and so runs on most embedded platforms. The main interior-point algorithm is a standard primal-dual Mehrotra predictor-corrector method with Nesterov-Todd scaling and self-dual embedding, with search directions found via a symmetric indefinite KKT system, chosen to allow stable factorization with a fixed pivoting order. The indefinite system is solved using Davis’ SparseLDL package, which we modify by adding dynamic regularization and iterative refinement for stability and reliability, as is done in the CVXGEN code generation system, allowing us to avoid all numerical pivoting; the elimination ordering is found entirely symbolically. This keeps the solver simple, only 750 lines of code, with virtually no variation in run time. For small problems, ECOS is faster than most existing SOCP solvers; it is still competitive for mediumsized problems up to tens of thousands of variables.},

  abstract = {With the increased use of high degree-of-freedom robots that must perform tasks in real-time, there is a need for fast algorithms for motion planning. In this work, we view motion planning from a probabilistic perspective. We consider smooth continuous-time trajectories as samples from a Gaussian process (GP) and formulate the planning problem as probabilistic inference. We use factor graphs and numerical optimization to perform inference quickly, and we show how GP interpolation can further increase the speed of the algorithm. Our framework also allows us to incrementally update the solution of the planning problem to contend with changing conditions. We benchmark our algorithm against several recent trajectory optimization algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that our approach is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the incremental version of our algorithm on replanning problems, and show that it often can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required to replan from scratch.},

In contrast to existing feedback controllers, our approach poses the nonconvex constrained nonlinear optimization problem as the tracking of a desired negative mode insertion gradient on the configuration space of a Lie group. This results in a closed-form feedback control law even with input saturation and thus is well suited for online application. In extending SAC to Lie groups, the associated mode insertion gradient is derived and the switching time optimization on Lie groups is studied. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach in the 2D kinematic car on SE(2) and the 3D quadrotor on SE(3). We also implement iLQG on a quadrator model and compare to SAC, demonstrating that SAC is both faster to compute and has a larger basin of attraction.},

However, modern systems often lack computationally tractable models, motivating the use of system identification techniques to learn accurate and efficient models for real-time control. In this tutorial article, we review emerging data-driven methods for model discovery and how they are used for nonlinear MPC. In particular, we focus on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and show how it may be used with MPC on an infectious disease control example. We compare the performance against MPC based on a linear dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) model. Code is provided to run the tutorial examples and may be modified to extend this data-driven control framework to arbitrary nonlinear systems.},

  abstract = {Many practical applications lead to optimization problems that can either be stated as quadratic programming (QP) problems or require the solution of QP problems on a lower algorithmic level. One relatively recent approach to solve QP problems are parametric active-set methods that are based on tracing the solution along a linear homotopy between a QP problem with known solution and the QP problem to be solved. This approach seems to make them particularly suited for applications where a-priori information can be used to speed-up the QP solution or where high solution accuracy is required. In this paper we describe the open-source C++ software package qpOASES, which implements a parametric active-set method in a reliable and efficient way. Numerical tests show that qpOASES can outperform other popular academic and commercial QP solvers on small- to medium-scale convex test examples of the MarosMészáros QP collection. Moreover, various interfaces to third-party software packages make it easy to use, even on embedded computer hardware. Finally, we describe how qpOASES can be used to compute critical points of nonconvex QP problems.},

The method is based on the Koopman operator approach to nonlinear dynamical systems analysis, which models the flow of observables in a function space, rather than a flow in a state space. Practically, this method estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher dimensional space where they are linear. Efficient Model Predictive Control methods can then be applied to the lifted model. This approach allows for real time implementation in on-board hardware, with rigorous incorporation of both input and state constraints during learning. We demonstrate the method in a real-time implementation of fast multirotor landing, where the nonlinear ground effect is learned and used to improve landing speed and quality.}

Using the Koopman canonical transform, control-affine dynamics can be expressed by a lifted bilinear model. The learned model is used for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) design where the bilinear structure can be exploited to improve computational efficiency. The benefits for control-affine dynamics compared to existing Koopman-based methods are highlighted through an example of a simulated planar quadrotor.

Koopman-based model learning methods can capture these nonlinear dynamical system effects in higher dimensional lifted bilinear models that are amenable to optimal control. However, standard methods that lift the system state using a fixed function dictionary before model learning result in high dimensional models that are intractable for real time control. This paper presents a novel method that jointly learns a function dictionary and lifted bilinear model purely from data by incorporating the Koopman model in a neural network architecture. Nonlinear MPC design utilizing the learned model can be performed readily. We experimentally realized this method on a multirotor drone for agile trajectory tracking at low altitudes where the aerodynamic ground effect influences the system's behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the learning-based controller achieves similar performance as a nonlinear MPC based on a nominal dynamics model in medium altitude. However, our learning-based system can reliably track trajectories in near-ground flight regimes while the nominal controller crashes due to unmodeled dynamical effects that are captured by our method.},

In the presented approach both the quadrotor's attitude model and the proposed non-linear Proportional squared (P2) control algorithm have been implemented in the quaternion space, without any transformations and calculations in the Euler's angle space or DCM. Throughout the article, the merits of the proposed novel approach are being analyzed and discussed, while the efficacy of the suggested novel quaternion based controller are being evaluated by extended simulation results.},

  abstract = {Controllers for articulated robots such as an arm or a humanoid commonly need to continuously calculate complex algebraic quantities, such as the joint space inertia matrix or Jacobians. An effective and fast implementation of the calculation of these quantities is crucial to achieve complex, yet robust controllers and thus enable sophisticated behaviors in robots. Although the nature of these algebraic quantities is very well known in robotics, they do not lend themselves easily to manual implementation, because of ambiguities and the complexity in their development and use. We propose an approach that addresses this issue by relying on automatic code generation, thus relieving the user from hand crafted development. Our approach also addresses efficiency and speed, in order to satisfy the strict requirements of real time robot controllers, yet it is easy to use. We show the effectiveness of our method by means of some preliminary comparisons.},

  abstract = {In Model Predictive Control (MPC), an optimization problem needs to be solved at each sampling time, and this has traditionally limited use of MPC to systems with slow dynamic. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the area of fast small-scale solvers for linear MPC, with the two main research areas of explicit MPC and tailored on-line MPC. State-of-the-art solvers in this second class can outperform optimized linear-algebra libraries (BLAS) only for very small problems, and do not explicitly exploit the hardware capabilities, relying on compilers for that. This approach can attain only a small fraction of the peak performance on modern processors. In our paper, we combine high-performance computing techniques with tailored solvers for MPC, and use the specific instruction sets of the target architectures. The resulting software (called HPMPC) can solve linear MPC problems 2 to 8 times faster than the current state-of-the-art solver for this class of problems, and the high-performance is maintained for MPC problems with up to a few hundred states.},

In addition, some of the constraints couple the positions and attitudes of the spacecraft, which makes the problems high-dimensional. The essential feature of the design methodology is the separation into a simplified path planning problem obtaining a feasible solution, then improving it significantly by a smoothing operation. The first step is solved using a rapidly-exploring random tree. The smoother then optimizes the trajectories by iteratively solving a linear program using a linearization of the cost function, dynamics, and constraints about the initial feasible solution. Examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the approach for complex problems with four spacecraft.},

Systems are often augmented with slung loads, inverted pendulums or arms, and accomplish complex tasks such as going through a window, grasping, throwing and catching.

Here we consider problems with general inequality constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that first derivatives are available and that the constraint gradients are sparse. Second derivatives are assumed to be unavailable or too expensive to calculate. We discuss an SQP algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function and makes explicit provision for infeasibility in the original problem and the QP subproblems. The Hessian of the Lagrangian is approximated using a limited-memory quasi-Newton method.},

The design objective of FROST is to provide a unified software environment for developing model-based control and motion planning algorithms for robotic systems whose dynamics is hybrid in nature. In particular, FROST uses directed graphs to describe the underlying discrete structure of hybrid system models, which renders it capable of representing a wide variety of robotic systems. Equipped with a custom symbolic math toolbox in MATLAB using Wolfram Mathematica, one can rapidly prototype the mathematical model of robot kinematics and dynamics and generate optimized code of symbolic expressions to boost the speed of optimization and simulation in FROST. In favor of agile and dynamic behaviors, we utilize virtual constraint based motion planning and feedback controllers for robotic systems to exploit the full-order dynamics of the model. Moreover, FROST provides a fast and tractable framework for planning optimal trajectories of hybrid dynamical systems using advanced direct collocation algorithms. FROST has been successfully used to synthesize dynamic walking in multiple bipedal robots. Case studies of such applications are considered in this paper, wherein different types of walking gaits are generated for two specific humanoid robots and validated in simulation.},

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm called Deep Value Model Predictive Control (DMPC), which combines model-based trajectory optimization with value function estimation. The DMPC actor is a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimizer with an objective function defined in terms of a value function estimated by the critic. We show that our MPC actor is an importance sampler, which minimizes an upper bound of the cross-entropy to the state distribution of the optimal sampling policy. In our experiments with a Ballbot system, we show that our algorithm can work with sparse and binary reward signals to efficiently solve obstacle avoidance and target reaching tasks. Compared to previous work, we show that including the value function in the running cost of the trajectory optimizer speeds up the convergence. We also discuss the necessary strategies to robustify the algorithm in practice.},

A parallelizable method is proposed that combines ideas from the fields of sequential quadratic programming and augmented Lagrangian algorithms. The method negotiates shared dual variables that may be interpreted as prices, a concept employed in dual decomposition methods and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Here, each agent solves its own small-scale nonlinear programming problem and communicates with other agents by solving coupled quadratic programming problems. These coupled quadratic programming problems have equality constraints for which parallelizable methods are available. The use of techniques associated with standard sequential quadratic programming methods gives a method with superlinear or quadratic convergence rate under suitable conditions. This is in contrast to existing decomposition methods, such as ADMM, which have a linear convergence rate. It is shown how the proposed algorithm may be extended using globalization techniques that guarantee convergence to a local minimizer from any initial starting point.},

However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints.

This paper summarized the basic principle, characteristics and application for all kinds of current trajectory optimization algorithms; and introduced some new methods and theories appearing in recent years. Finally, collaborative trajectory optimization for many flight vehicles, and hypersonic vehicle trajectory optimization were mainly reviewed in this paper. In the conclusion of this paper, the future research properties are presented regarding to numerical algorithms of trajectory optimization and control for flight vehicles as follows: collaboration and antagonization for many flight vehicles and multiple targets, global, real-time online, high accuracy of 7-D trajectory, considering all kinds of unknown random disturbances in trajectory optimization, and so on.},

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control method which has proven robust to modeling error and disturbances. However, it can be difficult to implement for high degree of freedom (DoF) systems due to the optimization problem that must be solved. While evolutionary algorithms have proven effective for complex large-scale optimization problems, they have not been formulated to find solutions quickly enough for use with MPC. This work details the implementation of a parallelized evolutionary MPC (EMPC) algorithm which is able to run in real-time through the use of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This parallelization is accomplished by simulating candidate control input trajectories in parallel on the GPU. We show that this framework is more flexible in terms of cost function definition than traditional MPC and that it shows promise for finding solutions for high DoF systems.},

In recent years however, research in optimization, optimal control, and simulation has enabled some forms of nonlinear model predictive control which find locally optimal solutions. The limiting factor for applying nonlinear MPC for robotics remains the computation necessary to solve the optimization, especially for complex systems and for long time horizons. This letter presents a new solution method which addresses computational concerns related to nonlinear MPC called nonlinear Evolutionary MPC (NEMPC), and then we compare it to several existing methods. These comparisons include simulations on torque-limited robots performing a swing-up task and demonstrate that NEMPC is able to discover complex behaviors to accomplish the task. Comparisons with state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC algorithms show that NEMPC finds high quality control solutions very quickly using a global, instead of local, optimization method. Finally, an application in hardware (a 24 state pneumatically actuated continuum soft robot) demonstrates that this method is tractable for real-time control of high degree of freedom systems.},

A custom quadratic programming (QP) solver implementation on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) can provide substantial acceleration by exploiting the parallelism inherent in some optimization algorithms, apart from providing novel computational opportunities arising from deep pipelining. This paper presents a new MPC algorithm based on multiplexed MPC that can take advantage of the full potential of an existing FPGA design by utilizing the provided ‘free’ parallel computational channels arising from such pipelining. The result is greater acceleration over a conventional MPC implementation and reduced silicon usage. The FPGA implementation is shown to be approximately 200x more energy efficient than a high performance general purpose processor (GPP) for large control problems.},

This paper presents a novel online QP algorithm that aims at combining the respective advantages of existing methods. It allows for efficient hot-starts of the QP solution and exploits the parametric nature of the problem like other active-set methods. Moreover, like interior-point or fast gradient methods, it directly exploits the inherent sparsity of QP problems arising in MPC and is designed to be easily parallelizable. The proposed parallel active-set strategy is described in detail for MPC problems with diagonal weighting matrices that are subject to state and control bounds; also an extension to the general case is sketched. Numerical properties of the proposed algorithm are discussed and preliminary numerical results are given that are based on a prototype Matlab implementation.},

Also, to enable data association in real time, we provide efficient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix.

Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency through incremental variable re-ordering and fluid relinearization, eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze various properties of iSAM2 in detail, and show on a range of real and simulated datasets that our algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},

In practice, however, it often requires an expert to craft and tune this cost function and find trade-offs between different state penalties to satisfy simple high level objectives. In this paper, we use Reinforcement Learning and in particular value learning to approximate the value function given only high level objectives , which can be sparse and binary. Building upon previous works, we present improvements that allowed us to successfully deploy the method on a real world unmanned ground vehicle. Our experiments show that our method can learn the cost function from scratch and without human intervention , while reaching a performance level similar to that of an expert-tuned MPC. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods with standard MPC approaches both in simulation and on the real robot.

We start by using trapezoidal collocation to solve a simple one-dimensional toy problem and work up to using Hermite--Simpson collocation to compute the optimal gait for a bipedal walking robot. Along the way, we cover basic debugging strategies and guidelines for posing well-behaved optimization problems. The paper concludes with a short overview of other methods for trajectory optimization. We also provide an electronic supplement that contains well-documented MATLAB code for all examples and methods presented.

This is accomplished by defining both the dynamics and the optimal control solution as sequences of vector fields mapping to curves on the Lie group through retraction maps, and defining variations and differentiation with respect to such vector fields. As a result, standard trajectory optimization methods can be easily extended to the Lie group setting without loss of efficiency. The methods are illustrated with three numerical examples: a quadrotor, an aerial vehicle with manipulators, and a simple nonholonomic system.},

Before obtaining it, several challenges should be faced: computation cost, non-linear local minima, algorithm stability, etc. In this paper, we address the problem of applying the updated optimal control in real-time on the physical robot. In particular, we focus on the problems raised by the delays due to computation and by the differences between the real robot and the simulated model. Based on the optimal-control solver MuJoCo, we implemented a complete model-predictive controller and we applied it in real-time on the physical HRP-2 robot. It is the first time that such a whole-body model predictive controller is applied in real-time on a complex dynamic robot. Aside from the technical contributions cited above, the main contribution of this paper is to report the experimental results of this première implementation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift (or embed) the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to numerical approximations of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and apply the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form of a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple-it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system with the same number of control inputs and the same dimension of the state-space. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. We treat both the full-state measurement case and the input-output case, as well as systems with disturbances/noise. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach. 1},

In this paper, we propose an effcient and exible algorithm for real-time nonlinear MPC which tries to combine the advantages of the two approaches by means of a block condensing technique. Using a nontrivial benchmarking problem, we show that this approach can improve the performance of the dual Newton strategy by a factor of 10 in terms of total computation times while reducing the delay between state estimate and feedback even further.

The latter employs techniques from standard Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) methods within a more parallelizable framework. An implementation tailored to optimal control is proposed where Nonlinear Programs (NLPs) are solved approximately and concurrently on each stage while a centralized consensus step is used to update the dual variables of the coupling constraints. The implementation also comprises algorithmic concepts to extend the parallelizability of the consensus step and a blocking technique to accelerate convergence. The performance of the resulting scheme is illustrated using as benchmark example the control of an overhead crane.},

We find that, in general, ASM gives lower complexity and converges faster when the numbers of decision variables and constraints are small. Otherwise, IPM should be a better choice due to its scalability. We also note occasional instability of both IPM and ASM when they are implemented in our FPGA, which uses single precision floating point arithmetic.

  abstract = {Optimal design and operation of complex chemical processes often require the solution of intricate dynamic optimization problems. A tailored simultaneous solution strategy based on multiple shooting and reduced SQP is presented. This reduced-space boundary value problem (BVP) approach allows an efficient and robust solution of multistage optimal control and design optimization problems for large, sparse DAE process models of index one. The current paper describes the theoretical aspects of the method. Utilizing the natural decomposition of the states into differential and algebraic variables, the structured NLP problem which results from the multiple shooting discretization of the optimization BVP is projected onto the reduced space of differential variables and control parameters. It is shown that this projection can be obtained very efficiently through direct computation of the reduced linearized constraint system via directional sensitivities. Like the original full-space BVP approach, the reduced-space formulation lends itself well to parallel computation. An implementation of the new strategy is provided by the modular optimal control package MUSCOD-II. Software aspects and applications are discussed in a second paper (Part II Software Aspects and Applications, 2002).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a two-phase augmented Lagrangian method, called QSDPNAL, for solving convex quadratic semidefinite programming (QSDP) problems with constraints consisting of a large number of linear equality and inequality constraints, a simple convex polyhedral set constraint, and a positive semidefinite cone constraint. A first order algorithm which relies on the inexact Schur complement based decomposition technique is developed in QSDPNAL-Phase I with the aim of solving a QSDP problem to moderate accuracy or using it to generate a reasonably good initial point for the second phase. In QSDPNAL-Phase II, we design an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) wherein the inner subproblem in each iteration is solved via inexact semismooth Newton based algorithms. Simple and implementable stopping criteria are designed for the ALM. Moreover, under mild conditions, we are able to establish the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm and prove the R-(super)linear convergence of the KKT residual. In the implementation of QSDPNAL, we also develop efficient techniques for solving large scale linear systems of equations under certain subspace constraints. More specifically, simpler and yet better conditioned linear systems are carefully designed to replace the original linear systems and novel shadow sequences are constructed to alleviate the numerical difficulties brought about by the crucial subspace constraints. Extensive numerical results for various large scale QSDPs show that our two-phase algorithm is highly efficient and robust in obtaining accurate solutions.

  abstract = {Developing robust walking controllers for bipedal robots is a challenging endeavor. Traditional model-based locomotion controllers require simplifying assumptions and careful modelling; any small errors can result in unstable control. To address these challenges for bipedal locomotion, we present a model-free reinforcement learning framework for training robust locomotion policies in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. To facilitate sim-to-real transfer, domain randomization is used to encourage the policies to learn behaviors that are robust across variations in system dynamics. The learned policies enable Cassie to perform a set of diverse and dynamic behaviors, while also being more robust than traditional controllers and prior learning-based methods that use residual control. We demonstrate this on versatile walking behaviors such as tracking a target walking velocity, walking height, and turning yaw. (Video).}

  abstract = {In this paper, we adopt the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to solve convex quadratic second-order cone programming problems (SOCPs). Fruitful results on the efficiency of the ALM have been established in the literature. Recently, it has been shown by Cui et al. (2019) that, if the quadratic growth condition holds at an optimal solution for the dual problem, then the KKT residual converges to zero R-superlinearly when the ALM is applied to the primal problem. Moreover, Cui et al (2017) provided sufficient conditions for the quadratic growth condition to hold under the metric subregularity and bounded linear regularity conditions for solving composite matrix optimization problems involving spectral functions. Here, we adopt these recent ideas to analyze the convergence properties of the ALM when applied to SOCPs. To the best of our knowledge, no similar work has been done for SOCPs so far. In our paper, we first provide sufficient conditions to ensure the quadratic growth condition for SOCPs. With these elegant theoretical guarantees, we then design an SOCP solver and apply it to solve various classes of SOCPs such as minimal enclosing ball problems, classic trust-region subproblems, square-root Lasso problems, and DIMACS Challenge problems. Numerical results show that the proposed ALM based solver is efficient and robust compared to the existing highly developed solvers such as Mosek and SDPT3.},

The first procedure solves a quadratic programming problem at every time step and thus constructs the differential control law, and the other one uses the multiplier method to sum up all the point-wise constraints and then uses the unconstrained DDP approach to construct the differential control law. In the first approach, the constraints need to be explicitly dependent on the control variables when continuous-time model is used, whereas in the second approach, there is no such limitation. Therefore the second approach is more general than the first one. Detailed algorithms are given for numerical implementation.

We generalize this method without degrading the time and space bounds so that it applies to any system of equations defined on a planar or almost-planar graph. Such systems arise in the solution of two-dimensional finite element problems. Our method uses the fact that planar graphs have good separators.More generally, we show that sparse Gaussian elimination is efficient for any class of graphs which have good separators, and conversely that graphs without good separators (including “almost all” sparse graphs) are not amenable to sparse Gaussian elimination.},

SOCPs are nonlinear convex problems that include linear and (convex) quadratic programs as special cases, but are less general than semidefinite programs (SDPs). Several efficient primal-dual interior-point methods for SOCP have been developed in the last few years. After reviewing the basic theory of SOCPs, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as SOCPs. These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving SOCPs, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming (LP): Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

The computational time taken to optimize problems formulated as Linear Programming, Integer Linear Programming or Quadratic Programming has an immediate impact on countless application fields, and it is critical to determining which problems we will be able to solve in the future. Since the very beginning, the research community has always been investigating on new algorithmic and numerical techniques to speed up convex optimization. Recently, the focus has included parallel computer architectures and their ability to perform high-throughput computation. This dissertation continues on the same research direction developing novel computational techniques tailored for modern GPUs. We focus on problems with sparse structure which are, arguably, the most challenging to solve on throughput-oriented many-core architectures naturally well-suited for dense computations As original contribution, we combine the leading ideas in SpMV optimization on GPUs into an advanced sparse format known as AdELL+. We also speed up the class of optimization algorithms known as Interior Points Methods with GPU-based adaptive strategies to select between Cholesky factorization and Conjugate Gradient. Last, we design an incremental matrix data structure that provides the foundation for implementing “branch-and-cut” ILP solvers.},

Motion planning algorithms that explicitly reason about robustness require a coupling of trajectory optimization and feedback design, where the system’s closedloop response to bounded disturbances is optimized. Due to the often-heavy computational demands of solving such problems, the practical application of robust trajectory optimization in robotics has so far been limited. We derive a tractable robust optimization algorithm that combines direct transcription with linear-quadratic control design to reason about closed-loop responses to disturbances. In the case of ellipsoidal disturbance sets, the state and input deviations along a nominal trajectory can be computed locally in closed form, thus allowing for fast evaluations of robust cost and constraint functions. The resulting algorithm, called DIRTREL, is an extension of classical direct transcription that demonstrably improves tracking performance over non-robust formulations while incurring only a modest increase in computational cost. We evaluate the algorithm in several simulated robot control tasks.},

  abstract = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using this dynamics formulation as constraints in a direct trajectory optimization scheme, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly improved accuracy compared to existing methods. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems.},

Crocoddyl efficiently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predefined sequence of contacts. Its efficiency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. We have unified dynamics, costs, and constraints into a single concept — action — for greater efficiency and easy prototyping. Additionally, we propose a novel multipleshooting method called Feasibility-prone Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). Our novel method shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms, and it has similar numerical behavior to state-of-the-art multiple-shooting methods. However, our method does not increase the computational complexity typically encountered by adding extra variables to describe the gaps in the dynamics. Concretely, we propose two modifications to the classical DDP algorithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early “exploratory” iterations (as expected in multiple-shooting methods). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highly-dynamic maneuvers for legged robots (e.g. jumping, front-flip) in the order of milliseconds.},

  abstract = {Birds routinely execute post-stall maneuvers with a speed and precision far beyond the capabilities of our best aircraft control systems. One remarkable example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority, and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR), we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear model-predictive control and ‘LQR-Trees’. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the ‘LQR-Trees’ algorithm is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the ‘LQR-Trees’ algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that, at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust perching even in the post-stall flow regime.}

We then provide a gradient-based optimization technique that optimizes continuous-time trajectories with respect to a cost functional. By exploiting GP interpolation, we develop the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP), that finds optimal trajectories parameterized by a small number of states.

  abstract = {In this work, a predictive control framework is presented for feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems. To achieve this, we integrate Koopman operator theory with Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC). The main idea is to transform nonlinear dynamics from state-space to function space using Koopman eigenfunctions-for control affine systems this results in a bilinear model in the (lifted) function space. Then, a predictive controller is formulated in Koopman eigenfunction coordinates which uses an auxiliary Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) based bounded controller as a constraint to ensure stability of the Koopman system in the function space. Provided there exists a continuously differentiable inverse mapping between the original state-space and (lifted) function space, we show that the designed controller is capable of translating the feedback stabiliz-ability of the Koopman bilinear system to the original nonlinear system. Remarkably, the feedback control design proposed in this work remains completely data-driven and does not require any explicit knowledge of the original system. Furthermore, due to the bilinear structure of the Koopman model, seeking a CLF is no longer a bottleneck for LMPC. Benchmark numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed feedback control design.},

  abstract = {Many robotics applications require smooth orientation planning, i.e. interpolation or approximation of a frame orientation through prescribed configurations such that the angular velocity and its time derivatives are smooth. This for instance ensures the continuity of the motor torques of robotic manipulator. Yet no satisfactory solution to this problem has been presented. This paper presents a solution using a B-spline parameterization of rotations. The method allows for a continuous interpolation and approximation through a given set of quaternions up to a specified order. The algorithm resembles the well-known B-spline interpolation in the sense that it boils down to solving a system of linear equations. The method is demonstrated for a polishing application (car fender) with an industrial robot.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to reduce the computational complexity of including second-order dynamics sensitivity information into the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) trajectory optimization algorithm. A tensor-free approach to DDP is developed where all the necessary derivatives are computed with the same complexity as in the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator\textasciitilde (iLQR). Compared to linearized models used in iLQR, DDP more accurately represents the dynamics locally, but it is not often used since the second-order derivatives of the dynamics are tensorial and expensive to compute. This work shows how to avoid the need for computing the derivative tensor by instead leveraging reverse-mode accumulation of derivative information to compute a key vector-tensor product directly. We benchmark this approach for trajectory optimization with multi-link manipulators and show that the benefits of DDP can often be included without sacrificing evaluation time, and can be done in fewer iterations than iLQR.},

We show that the original SLAM graph can be recursively partitioned into multiple-level submaps using the nested dissection algorithm, which leads to the cluster tree, a powerful graph representation. By employing the nested dissection algorithm, our algorithm greatly minimizes the dependencies between two subtrees, and the optimization of the original SLAM graph can be done using a bottom-up inference along the corresponding cluster tree. To speed up the computation, we also introduce a base node for each submap and use it to represent the rigid transformation of the submap in the global coordinate frame. As a result, the optimization moves the base nodes rather than the actual submap variables. We demonstrate that our algorithm is not only exact but also much faster than alternative approaches in both simulations and real-world experiments.},

The method uses an operator splitting method, the alternating directions method of multipliers, to solve the homogeneous self-dual embedding, an equivalent feasibility problem involving finding a nonzero point in the intersection of a subspace and a cone. This approach has several favorable properties. Compared to interior-point methods, first-order methods scale to very large problems, at the cost of requiring more time to reach very high accuracy. Compared to other first-order methods for cone programs, our approach finds both primal and dual solutions when available or a certificate of infeasibility or unboundedness otherwise, is parameter free, and the per-iteration cost of the method is the same as applying a splitting method to the primal or dual alone. We discuss efficient implementation of the method in detail, including direct and indirect methods for computing projection onto the subspace, scaling the original problem data, and stopping criteria. We describe an open-source implementation, which handles the usual (symmetric) nonnegative, second-order, and semidefinite cones as well as the (non-self-dual) exponential and power cones and their duals. We report numerical results that show speedups over interior-point cone solvers for large problems, and scaling to very large general cone programs.},

We show for the first time that the classical computer vision problem of bundle adjustment (BA) can be solved extremely fast on a graph processor using Gaussian Belief Propagation. Our simple but fully parallel implementation uses the 1216 cores on a single IPU chip to, for instance, solve a real BA problem with 125 keyframes and 1919 points in under 40ms, compared to 1450ms for the Ceres CPU library. Further code optimisation will surely increase this difference on static problems, but we argue that the real promise of graph processing is for flexible in-place optimisation of general, dynamically changing factor graphs representing Spatial AI problems. We give indications of this with experiments showing the ability of GBP to efficiently solve incremental SLAM problems, and deal with robust cost functions and different types of factors.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is an essential tool for motion planning under multiple constraints of robotic manipulators. Optimization-based methods can explicitly optimize a trajectory by leveraging prior knowledge of the system and have been used in various applications such as collision avoidance. However, these methods often require a hand-coded cost function in order to achieve the desired behavior. Specifying such cost function for a complex desired behavior, e.g., disentangling a rope, is a nontrivial task that is often even infeasible. Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods offer an alternative way to program robot motion. LfD methods are less dependent on analytical models and instead learn the behavior of experts implicitly from the demonstrated trajectories. However, the problem of adapting the demonstrations to new situations, e.g., avoiding newly introduced obstacles, has not been fully investigated in the literature. In this letter, we present a motion planning framework that combines the advantages of optimization-based and demonstration-based methods. We learn a distribution of trajectories demonstrated by human experts and use it to guide the trajectory optimization process. The resulting trajectory maintains the demonstrated behaviors, which are essential to performing the task successfully, while adapting the trajectory to avoid obstacles. In simulated experiments and with a real robotic system, we verify that our approach optimizes the trajectory to avoid obstacles and encodes the demonstrated behavior in the resulting trajectory.},

Our approach uses a fully differentiable dynamic model of the articulated body, and a smooth force model that approximates all kinds of internal/external forces as a smooth function of the articulated body’s kinematic state. Our formulation is contact-aware and its complexity is not dependent on the contact positions or the number of contacts. Furthermore, we exploit the block-tridiagonal structure of the Hessian matrix and present a highly parallel Newton-type trajectory optimizer that maps well to GPU architectures. Moreover, we use a Markovian regularization term to overcome the local minima problems in the optimization formulation. We highlight the performance of our approach using a set of locomotion tasks performed by characters with 15 − 35 DOFs. In practice, our GPU-based algorithm running on a NVIDIA TITAN-X GPU provides more than 30× speedup over a multi-core CPU-based implementation running on Intel Xeon E5-1620 CPU.

They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical al- gorithms like Newton’s method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed- form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpreta- tions of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for the generation of high-speed running jumps to clear terrain obstacles in quadrupedal robots. Our methods enable the quadruped to autonomously jump over obstacles up to 40 cm in height within a single control framework. Specifically, we propose new control system components, layered on top of a low-level running controller, which actively modify the approach and select stance force profiles as required to clear a sensed obstacle. The approach controller enables the quadruped to end in a preferable state relative to the obstacle just before the jump. This multi-step gait planning is formulated as a multiple-horizon model predictive control problem and solved at each step through quadratic programming. Ground reaction force profiles to execute the running jump are selected through constrained nonlinear optimization on a simplified model of the robot that possesses polynomial dynamics. Exploiting the simplified structure of these dynamics, the presented method greatly accelerates the computation of otherwise costly function and constraint evaluations that are required during optimization. With these considerations, the new algorithms allow for online planning that is critical for reliable response to unexpected situations. Experimental results, for a stand-alone quadruped with on-board power and computation, show the viability of this approach, and represent important steps towards broader dynamic maneuverability in experimental machines.},

Until recently, most trajectory optimization methods for systems with contacts employ mode-scheduling, which requires an a priori knowledge of the contact order and thus cannot produce complex or non-intuitive behaviors. Contact-implicit trajectory optimization methods offer a solution to this by allowing the optimization to make or break contacts as needed, but thus far have suffered from poor accuracy. Here, we combine methods from direct collocation using higher order orthogonal polynomials with contact-implicit optimization to generate trajectories with significantly improved accuracy. The key insight is to increase the order of the polynomial representation while maintaining the assumption that impact occurs over the duration of one finite element.},

  abstract = {A general-purpose MATLAB software program called GPOPS--II is described for solving multiple-phase optimal control problems using variable-order Gaussian quadrature collocation methods. The software employs a Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature orthogonal collocation method where the continuous-time optimal control problem is transcribed to a large sparse nonlinear programming problem (NLP). An adaptive mesh refinement method is implemented that determines the number of mesh intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval to achieve a specified accuracy. The software can be interfaced with either quasi-Newton (first derivative) or Newton (second derivative) NLP solvers, and all derivatives required by the NLP solver are approximated using sparse finite-differencing of the optimal control problem functions. The key components of the software are described in detail and the utility of the software is demonstrated on five optimal control problems of varying complexity. The software described in this article provides researchers a useful platform upon which to solve a wide variety of complex constrained optimal control problems.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the success of the Koopman operator in dynamical systems analysis has also fueled the development of Koopman operator-based control frameworks. In order to preserve the relatively low data requirements for an approximation via dynamic mode decomposition, a quantization approach was recently proposed in [S. Peitz and S. Klus, Automatica J. IFAC, 106 (2019), pp. 184- 191]. This way, control of nonlinear dynamical systems can be realized by means of switched systems techniques, using only a finite set of autonomous Koopman operator-based reduced models. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently from data. The main idea is to transform a control system into a set of autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed. In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using relaxation. This way, we combine the advantages of the data efficiency of approximating a finite set of autonomous systems with continuous controls, as the data requirements increase only linearly with the input dimension. We show that when using the Koopman generator, this relaxation-realized by linear interpolation between two operators-does not introduce any error for control affine systems. This allows us to control high-dimensional nonlinear systems using bilinear, low-dimensional surrogate models. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several examples with increasing complexity, from the Duffing oscillator to the chaotic fluidic pinball.},

In this paper series, motivated by the challenges of optimizing highly sensitive spacecraft trajectories, the multiple-shooting approach is embedded for the first time in the formulation of a Differential Dynamic Programming algorithm. Contrary to traditional nonlinear programming methods which necessitate minimal modification of the formulation in order to incorporate multiple-shooting principles, DDP requires novel non-trivial derivations, in order to include the initial conditions of the multiple-shooting subintervals and track their sensitivities. The initial conditions are updated in a necessary additional algorithmic step. A null-space trust-region method is used for the solution of the quadratic subproblems, and equality and inequality path and terminal constraints are handled through a general augmented Lagrangian approach. The propagation of the trajectory and the optimization of its controls are decoupled through the use of State-Transition Matrices. Part 1 of the paper series provides the necessary theoretical developments and implementation details for the algorithm. Part 2 contains validation and application cases.},

  abstract = {Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) has become a popular approach to performing trajectory optimization for complex, underactuated robots. However, DDP presents two practical challenges. First, the evaluation of dynamics derivatives during optimization creates a computational bottleneck, particularly in implementations that capture second-order dynamic effects. Second, constraints on the states (e.g., boundary conditions, collision constraints, etc.) require additional care since the state trajectory is implicitly defined from the inputs and dynamics. This paper addresses both of these problems by building on recent work on Unscented Dynamic Programming (UDP) - which eliminates dynamics derivative computations in DDP-to support general nonlinear state and input constraints using an augmented Lagrangian. The resulting algorithm has the same computational cost as first-order penalty-based DDP variants, but can achieve constraint satisfaction to high precision without the numerical ill-conditioning associated with penalty methods. We present results demonstrating its favorable performance on several simulated robot systems including a quadrotor and 7-DoF robot arm.},

We describe our implementation strategy and present results demonstrating its performance compared to an equivalent multi-threaded CPU implementation using several benchmark control tasks.

  abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

For actuated systems, standard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output models; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to allow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this generalization is rigorously connected to a recent development called dynamic mode decomposition with control. We demonstrate this new theory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

  abstract = {Dynamic optimization based control and estimation techniques have gained increasing popularity, because of their ability to treat a wide range of problems and applications. They rely on the explicit formulation of a cost function, which needs to be minimized given the constraints of the problem and the system dynamics. Especially in the context of real-time applications of control and estimation on embedded hardware, the computational burden associated with the online solution of the optimal control problem forms the main limiting factor in the deployment of such an advanced strategy. For that purpose, this thesis considers the development of tailored algorithms of simulation methods for embedded optimization that allows for an efficient implementation of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) or moving horizon estimation (MHE). A direct treatment of the optimal control problem requires the numerical simulation of the continuous time nonlinear dynamics and the solution of the resulting large but structured optimization problem. We additionally propose a new format to define the dynamic model, which allows one to directly exploit the present structure of linear or partially linear subsystems in the formulation of the system dynamics. In addition, we also discuss embedded optimization algorithms for a more general set of interconnected subsystems based on a distributed multiple shooting technique. As we focus on Newton-type optimization algorithms, it is important to extend the numerical simulation method with an efficient propagation of its first and possibly higher order derivative information. We discuss the tailored implementation of such a sensitivity analysis for both explicit and implicit integration, such as the collocation methods that form a specific family of implicit Runge-Kutta schemes. In addition, a novel Hessian propagation scheme is proposed for both a discrete and continuous time sensitivity analysis, which allows one to maintain and exploit the symmetry of the second order derivatives. Based on these symmetric sensitivity equations, an alternative three-sweep propagation (TSP) technique is presented and analyzed. When embedding an implicit integration scheme within a direct multiple shooting based Newton-type optimization algorithm, one ends up with an outer and inner level of iterations which is typically not the most efficient computational approach. We therefore propose an alternative implementation, which we refer to as a lifted collocation integrator, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to multiple shooting and direct collocation. Two alternative extensions to inexact Newton based optimization are presented, using either an adjoint differentiation technique or an iterative sensitivity propagation. We establish new theoretical results on the local convergence of this inexact Newton scheme with iterated sensitivities. Unlike for previously existing algorithms, we show that local convergence for the inner scheme is necessary and often also sufficient for asymptotic contraction of the new proposed optimization method. In addition to the use of tailored optimal control algorithms, the performance of embedded applications strongly relies on efficient code implementations. This thesis therefore includes an implementation of the major new algorithmic techniques as part of the automatic code generation tool within the open-source ACADO Toolkit software package. We discuss some of the main real-world control applications that were made possible using such an ACADO code generated solver. More specifically, we discuss the airpath control for a two-stage turbocharged gasoline engine in more detail. The resulting NMPC scheme on the dSpace MicroAutoBox is shown to meet the challenging demands of this control application, with a sampling time of 25 ms. It is validated based on closed-loop simulations as well as in-vehicle experimental results.},

The method taps the potential of the graphic processing unit (GPU) to simulate the system parallelly for several combinations of control inputs and the optimal input is elicited which minimizes the objective function and satisfies the constraints. The method was tested in MATLAB/Simulink environment by means of simulations and a comparative study was conducted with ACADO-qpOASES NMPC framework. The simulation results display better performance of the proposed approach in terms of computation time, closed loop objective, and constraint satisfaction when juxtaposed to the ACADO-qpOASES NMPC controller.},

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate “narrow passages” can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

The connections are used to derive benchmark metrics and strategies to monitor and accelerate convergence and to help explain why ADMM and PH are capable of solving complex nonconvex NLPs. Specifically, we observe that ADMM is an inexact version of MM and approaches its performance when multiple coordination steps are performed. In addition, we use the observation that PH is a specialization of ADMM and borrow Lyapunov function and primal-dual feasibility metrics used in ADMM to explain why PH is capable of solving nonconvex NLPs. This analysis also highlights that specialized PH schemes can be derived to tackle a wider range of stochastic programs and even other problem classes. Our exposition is tutorial in nature and seeks to to motivate algorithmic improvements and new decomposition strategies},

  abstract = {Terminal guidance of autonomous parafoils is a difficult problem in which wind uncertainty and system underactuation are major challenges. Existing strategies almost exclusively use impact error as the criterion for optimality. Practical airdrop systems, however, must also include other criteria that may be even more important than impact error for some missions, such as ground speed at impact or constraints imposed by drop zones with restrictions on flight patterns. Furthermore, existing guidance schemes determine terminal trajectories using deterministic wind information and may result in a solution that works in ideal wind but may be sensitive to variations. The work described here develops a guidance strategy that uses massively parallel Monte Carlo simulation performed on a graphics processing unit to rank candidate trajectories in terms of robustness to wind uncertainty. The result is robust guidance, as opposed to optimal guidance. Through simulation results, the proposed path planning scheme proves more robust in realistic dynamic wind environments compared with previous optimal trajectory planners that assume perfect knowledge of a constant wind.},

The objectives considered in the trajectory optimization include but are not limited to the overall path length, trajectory execution time, separation from obstacles, passing through intermediate way points and compliance with the robots dynamic, kinematic and geometric constraints. “Timed elastic bands” explicitly consider spatial-temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The trajectory planning operates in real time such that “timed elastic bands” cope with dynamic obstacles and motion constraints. The “timed elastic band problem” is formulated as a scalarized multi-objective optimization problem. Most objectives are local and relate to only a small subset of parameters as they only depend on a few consecutive robot states. This local structure results in a sparse system matrix, which allows the utilization of fast and efficient optimization techniques such as the open-source framework “g2o” for solving “timed elastic band” problems. The “g2o” sparse system solvers have been successfully applied to VSLAM problems. This contribution describes the application and adaptation of the g2o-framework in the context of trajectory modification with the “timed elastic band”. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the implementation is robust and computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has been used in many industrial applications because of its ability to produce optimal performance while accommodating constraints. However, its application on plants with fast time constants is difficult because of its computationally expensive algorithm. In this research, we propose a parallelized MPC that makes use of the structure of the computations and the matrices in the MPC. We show that the computational time of MPC with prediction horizon N can be reduced to O(log(N)) using parallel computing, which is significantly less than that with other available algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this paper we solve a class of optimal control problems on Lie groups in the sense that we derive differential equations which the optimal controis must satisfy. These results are applied to the attitude control of a spacecraft modeled as a rigid body. Specifically, we derive control laws (both in open-loop and closed-loop form) to maneuver the spacecraft between two given rotational states in finite time. The laws are such that a cost functional measuring the overall angular velocity during the spacecraft's motion is minimized. They do not require recourse to numerical methods and hence can be easily implemented in an on-board attitude control system. After dealing with a three-axis controlled spacecraft we also discuss the case that only torques about two principal axes of an axisymmetric spacecraft can be exerted.},

Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.},

  abstract = {In emergency situations, autonomous vehicles will be forced to operate at their friction limits in order to avoid collisions. In these scenarios, coordinating the planning of the vehicle's path and speed gives the vehicle the best chance of avoiding an obstacle. Fast reaction time is also important in an emergency, but approaches to the trajectory planning problem based on nonlinear optimization are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new scheme that simultaneously modifies the desired path and speed profile for a vehicle in response to the appearance of an obstacle, significant tracking error, or other environmental change. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, solution times of less than 20 ms are possible even with a 10-s planning horizon. A simplified point mass model is used to describe the vehicle's motion, but the incorporation of longitudinal weight transfer and road topography means that the vehicle's acceleration limits are modeled more accurately than in comparable approaches. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle in two scenarios demonstrate how the trajectory planner enables the vehicle to avoid an obstacle even when the obstacle appears suddenly and the vehicle is already operating near the friction limits.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the problem of pushing piles of small objects into a desired target set using visual feedback. Unlike conventional single-object manipulation pipelines, which estimate the state of the system parametrized by pose, the underlying physical state of this system is difficult to observe from images. Thus, we take the approach of reasoning directly in the space of images, and acquire the dynamics of visual measurements in order to synthesize a visual-feedback policy. We present a simple controller using an image-space Lyapunov function, and evaluate the closed-loop performance using three different class of models for image prediction: deep-learning-based models for image-to-image translation, an object-centric model obtained from treating each pixel as a particle, and a switched-linear system where an action-dependent linear map is used. Through results in simulation and experiment, we show that for this task, a linear model works surprisingly well – achieving better prediction error, downstream task performance, and generalization to new environments than the deep models we trained on the same amount of data. We believe these results provide an interesting example in the spectrum of models that are most useful for vision-based feedback in manipulation, considering both the quality of visual prediction, as well as compatibility with rigorous methods for control design and analysis.

  abstract = {Payload manipulation with aerial robots has been an active research area for many years. Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering. Unfortunately, the system's nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a significant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simplifications like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload. In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman filter. We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full three-dimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor. We show control of load swings up to 53o from the vertical axis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle.},

Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an indirect method which optimizes only over the unconstrained control-space and is therefore fast enough to allow real-time control of a full humanoid robot on modern computers. Although indirect methods automatically take into account state constraints, control limits pose a difficulty. This is particularly problematic when an expensive robot is strong enough to break itself. In this paper, we demonstrate that simple heuristics used to enforce limits (clamping and penalizing) are not efficient in general. We then propose a generalization of DDP which accommodates box inequality constraints on the controls, without significantly sacrificing convergence quality or computational effort. We apply our algorithm to three simulated problems, including the 36-DoF HRP-2 robot. A movie of our results can be found here goo.gl/eeiMnn.},

The linearized tracking error dynamics and the linearized equations of motion are derived in the Lie algebra. Moreover, given an initial condition, the linearized tracking error dynamics and equations of motion are globally valid and evolve independently of the system trajectory. By exploiting the symmetry of the problem, the proposed approach shows faster convergence of rotation and position simultaneously than the state-of-the-art geometric variational MPC based on variational-based linearization. Numerical simulation on tracking control of a fully-actuated 3D rigid body dynamics confirms the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the baselines. Furthermore, the proposed MPC is also verified in pose control and locomotion experiments on a quadrupedal robot MIT Mini Cheetah.}

We present here a compelling case for MRPs as a minimal degree-of-freedom parameterization of orientation through novel solutions to prominent problems in the fields of 3D vision and computer graphics. In our primary contribution, we show that the derivatives of a unit quaternion in terms of its MRPs are simple polynomial expressions of its scalar and vector part. Furthermore, we show that updates to unit quaternions from perturbations in parameter space can be computed without explicitly invoking the parameters in the computations. Based on the former, we introduce a novel approach for designing orientation splines by configuring their backprojections in 3D space. Finally, in the general topic of nonlinear optimization for geometric vision, we run performance analyses and provide comparisons on the convergence behavior of MRP parameterizations on the tasks of absolute orientation, exterior orientation and large-scale bundle adjustment of public datasets.},

  abstract = {We describe a new physics engine tailored to model-based control. Multi-joint dynamics are represented in generalized coordinates and computed via recursive algorithms. Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Motivated by robotic trajectory optimization problems we consider the Augmented Lagrangian approach to constrained optimization. We first propose an alternative augmentation of the Lagrangian to handle the inequality case (not based on slack variables) and a corresponding "central" update of the dual parameters. We proove certain properties of this update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when the "constraint activity" does not change between iterations, the KKT conditions hold after just one iteration. This gives essential insight on when the method is efficient in practise. We then present our main contribution, which are consistent any-time (non-central) updates of the dual parameters (i.e., updating the dual parameters when we are not currently at an extremum of the Lagrangian). Similar to the primal-dual Newton method, this leads to an algorithm that parallely updates the primal and dual solutions, not distinguishing between an outer loop to adapt the dual parameters and an inner loop to minimize the Lagrangian. We again proof certain properties of this anytime update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when constraint activities would not change, the dual solution converges after one iteration. Again, this gives essential insight in the caveats of the method: if constraint activities change the method may destablize. We propose simple smoothing, step-size adaptation and regularization mechanisms to counteract this effect and guarantee monotone convergence. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on random LPs as well as on standard robot trajectory optimization problems, confirming our motivation and intuition that our approach performs well if the problem structure implies moderate stability of constraint activity.},

A classical approximate solution is to first compute an optimal (deterministic) trajectory and then solve a local linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) perturbation model to handle the system stochasticity. We present a new algorithm for this approach which improves upon previous algorithms like iLQG. We consider a probabilistic model for which the maximum likelihood (ML) trajectory coincides with the optimal trajectory and which, in the LQG case, reproduces the classical SOC solution. The algorithm then utilizes approximate inference methods (similar to expectation propagation) that efficiently generalize to non-LQG systems. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simulated 39-DoF humanoid robot.},

The iSAC method has a closed-form openloop solution, which is iteratively updated between time steps by introducing constant control values applied for short duration. Application of a contractive constraint on the cost is shown to lead to closed-loop asymptotic stability under mild assumptions. The effect of asymptotically decaying disturbances on system trajectories is also examined. To demonstrate the applicability of iSAC to a variety of systems and conditions, we employ five different systems, including a 13-dimensional quaternionbased quadrotor. Each system is tested in different scenarios, ranging from feasible and infeasible trajectory tracking, to setpoint stabilization, with or without the presence of external disturbances. Finally, limitations of this work are discussed.},

The reason is the very easy construction and steering principle using four rotors in a cross configuration. However, stabilizing control and guidance of these vehicles is a difficult task because of the nonlinear dynamic behavior. In addition, the small payload and the reduced processing power of the onboard electronics are further limitations for any control system implementation. This paper describes the development of a nonlinear vehicle control system based on a decomposition into a nested structure and feedback linearization which can be implemented on an embedded microcontroller.

For the application in real-time grid operation and in cases when computational time is critical, a novel approach on parallelization of Newton-Raphson power flow for many calculations on CPU and with GPU-acceleration is proposed. The result shows a speed-up of over x100 comparing to the open-source tool pandapower, when performing repetitive power flows of system with admittance matrix of the same sparsity pattern on both CPU and GPU. The speed-up relies on the optimized algorithm and parallelization strategy, which can reduce the repetitive work and saturate the high hardware performance of modern CPUs and GPUs well. This is achieved with the proposed batched sparse matrix operation and batched linear solver based on LU-refactorization. The batched linear solver shows a large performance improvement comparing to the state-of-art linear system solver KLU library and a better saturation of the GPU performance with small problem scale. Finally, the method of integrating the proposed solver into pandapower is presented, thus the parallel power flow solver with outstanding performance can be easily applied in challenging real-life grid operation and innovative researches e.g. data-driven machine learning studies.},

These approaches rely on the construction of an element of the special orthogonal group (SO(3)) from a desired thrust vector direction which lies on a sphere (S2S2S\^2) and a desired yaw angle which lies on a circle (S1S1S\^1). The Hairy Ball Theorem can be applied to show that any construction of this type has to be discontinuous or degenerate somewhere. We propose a new geometric control algorithm based on the Hopf fibration, which allows us to place the point of discontinuity as far away from the hover configuration as possible and further than existing approaches. We then use multiple maps from S2×S1S2×S1S\^2\textbackslash times S\^1 to SO(3) to be able to control the quadrotor through any position and orientation. The proposed Hopf Fibration Control Algorithm (HFCA) is compared to existing geometric control algorithms in experiments and simulation. The HFCA employs multiple charts to allow the quadrotor to execute arbitrary dynamically feasible trajectories on SE(3), including those through configurations in which the vehicle is inverted.},

In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a “black box” integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the “stochastic Koopman operator” (Mezic in Nonlinear Dynamics 41(1–3): 309–325, 2005). Finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data and two that show potential applications of the Koopman eigenfunctions.},

This work is based on a recently proposed method that states the mechanical dynamics in a floating base description, makes the ground contact forces part of the free variable vector, and implements the requirement that a foot is either on the ground or that the corresponding contact force is zero via a set of complimentary conditions. We introduce an algorithmic improvement that uses higher order integration for states that are continuous through collisions and thus increases the accuracy of the obtained solutions. The benefits of the proposed changes are evaluated with the models of a 1D hopper and a 2D bipedal robot, and we additionally compare our results with analytic solutions and an established multiple shooting implementation. The proposed method was able to automatically discover walking and running as the most energetically economic ways of locomotion for a conceptual biped that is moving at different speed. It additionally discovers an elastic walking gait that is used at intermediate velocities.},

However, it does not handle either state or control constraints. This paper presents a novel formulation of DDP that is able to accommodate arbitrary nonlinear inequality constraints on both state and control. The main insight in standard DDP is that a quadratic approximation of the value function can be derived using a recursive backward pass, however the recursive formulae are only valid for unconstrained problems. The main technical contribution of the presented method is a derivation of the recursive quadratic approximation formula in the presence of nonlinear constraints, after a set of active constraints has been identified at each point in time. This formula is used in a new Constrained-DDP (CDDP) algorithm that iteratively determines these active set and is guaranteed to converge toward a local minimum. CDDP is demonstrated on several underactuated optimal control problems up to 12D with obstacle avoidance and control constraints and is shown to outperform other methods for accommodating constraints.},

However, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, making ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method that adaptively tunes the penalty parameter to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.}

Our experiments suggest that ADMM performs well on a broad class of non-convex problems.

Solutions typically require the calculation of the gradient and Hessian. However, real functions of quaternion variables are essentially nonanalytic, which are prohibitive to the development of quaternion-valued learning systems. To address this issue, we propose new definitions of quaternion gradient and Hessian, based on the novel generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus, thus making a possible efficient derivation of general optimization algorithms directly in the quaternion field, rather than using the isomorphism with the real domain, as is current practice. In addition, unlike the existing quaternion gradients, the GHR calculus allows for the product and chain rule, and for a one-to-one correspondence of the novel quaternion gradient and Hessian with their real counterparts. Properties of the quaternion gradient and Hessian relevant to numerical applications are also introduced, opening a new avenue of research in quaternion optimization and greatly simplified the derivations of learning algorithms. The proposed GHR calculus is shown to yield the same generic algorithm forms as the corresponding real- and complex-valued algorithms. Advantages of the proposed framework are illuminated over illustrative simulations in quaternion signal processing and neural networks.},

We prove that our approach has the same order of computational complexity as the state-of-the-art dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, current dynamic programming approaches can only handle equality constraints between variables at the same time step, but ours can handle equality constraints among any combination of variables at any time step while maintaining linear complexity with respect to trajectory length. Our approach can be used to efficiently generate trajectories and feedback control policies to achieve periodic motion or repetitive manipulation.},

  abstract = {GPU applications have traditionally run on PCs or in larger scale systems. With the introduction of the Tegra line of mobile processors, NVIDIA expanded the types of systems that can exploit the massive parallelism offered by GPU computing architectures. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of the Tegra X1 processor as a platform for embedded model predictive control. MPC relies on the real time solution of a convex optimization problem to compute the control input(s) to a system. Relative to traditional control techniques such as PID, MPC is very computationally demanding. Quadratic programming algorithms for the solution of convex optimization problems generally lend themselves to parallelization. However, until the introduction of the Tegra, there has never been an off-the-shelf embedded processor that would enable a massively parallel embedded implementation. We investigate two different gradient based algorithms, ADMM and PQP, for solving the QP that occurs in a large class of MPC problems. The performance of these algorithms is dominated by the performance of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector products. Our work focuses on maximizing the performance of these operations for relatively small matrices of 100 to 1000 elements per dimension, which are common in the MPC control implementations found in automotive and factory automation applications. Modern BLAS libraries for CPUs and GPUs are quantitatively evaluated. We create SGEMV kernels that can outperform the state-of-the-art cuBLAS by 2.3x on TX1. Different kernel fusion schemes utilizing concurrent kernel execution and zero copy mechanisms are investigated. For ADMM, our implementation achieves 46.6x speedup over the single threaded CPU version and 2.7x speedup over the optimized OpenBLAS version. For PQP, we achieve 41.2x speedup over the single threaded CPU version and 4.2x speedup over the OpenBLAS version.},

The main idea is to define a functional depending on velocity or its derivatives that measures smoothness of trajectories and find a trajectory that minimizes this functional. In order to ensure that the computed trajectories are independent of the parametrization of positions and orientations, we use the notions of Riemannian metric and covariant derivative from differential geometry and formulate the problem as a variational problem on the Lie group of spatial rigid body displacements. We show that by choosing an appropriate measure of smoothness, the trajectories can be made to satisfy boundary conditions on the velocities or higher order derivatives. Dynamically smooth trajectories can be obtained by incorporating the inertia of the system into the definition of the Riemannian metric. We state the necessary conditions for the shortest distance, minimum acceleration and minimum jerk trajectories.},
